# Policy-Incubator challenge (2020), imposed by the European Committee of the Regions

Contents:
- A method for stratified random sampling in small-N studies (stratification based on one background variable).
(The file: 20-03-03-140325 contains a partial revision of the initial sample).
- A Wordfish analysis both with the Text-Mining library (TM) and the Quanteda library.
- Graphics resulting from the Wordfish analysis.

Remarks:
- The wordclouds are produced after the data was stemmed, hence the words sometimes seem a little unnatural. 
- The estimates produced by the TM-version and Quanteda-version differ, we did not yet pinpoint why, but it might be due to a difference in which the data is cleaned.
